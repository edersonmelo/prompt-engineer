# Deploying LLaMA 3 70B with AirLLM and Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces

Deploying a Gradio app with the LLaMA 3 70B language model using AirLLM on Hugging Face Spaces. The app provides a user-friendly interface for generating text based on user prompts.

## Overview

- **LLaMA 3 70B**: A large language model developed by Meta AI with 70 billion parameters, capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
- **AirLLM**: A Python library that enables running large language models like LLaMA on consumer hardware with limited GPU memory by using layer-by-layer inferencing.
- **Gradio**: A Python library for quickly creating web interfaces for machine learning models, allowing users to interact with the models through a user-friendly UI.
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: A platform for hosting and sharing machine learning demos, allowing easy deployment and access to Gradio apps.
